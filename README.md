Your Ruby skills are unstoppable! Now it's time to put them to the test with some object oriented programming. 

Fork and clone this lab then follow the instructions and write your code in each of the numbered docs. Start with `1_dog.rb` and run `rspec spec/1_dog_spec.rb --fail-fast` to make sure your code is passing all the specs. Once you're done with `1_dog_spec.rb`, continue with the other tests (`2_is_between_spec.rb`, `3_fbook_user_spec.rb`, etc.).

You may need to run `bundle install` to install all of the Gems that you need.

Once you get the tests passing make sure that the lab is forked onto your own account. 
**Check this by typing `git remote -v` in the terminal - you should see your github username in the remote address.** 

Then push your work onto github and make a pull request so we can check out your mad skillz!
