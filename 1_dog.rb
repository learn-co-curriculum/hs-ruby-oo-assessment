# Test out your new Dog class! 

# 1. Create a new instance of a Dog with the breed "Beagle" and the name "Snoopy". You should store this new dog instance in a variable so you can easily call methods on it - like `snoopy.bark`.

# 2. You decide to give your dog a more original name. Set his name to something new.

# 3. Make your dog bark.

# 4. Scratch the dogs ears until he is happy enough to wag his tail.

# 5. Make the dog's tail wag.

# Run the file from your terminal to see if it worked.
